## Overview

This was my second project and second time I used the agile methodologies. The GitHub project board served as my primary tool for organizing user stories. Opting for the GitHub board was a deliberate choice due to its simplicity and alignment with my learning path from the LMS course.

Initially, grappling with user stories posed a challenge, but after a day's immersion, I found myself growing more adept at handling them. I began by crafting detailed features for each task and those indispensable for the overall project. Categorizing issues into relevant groups and subsequently into their respective epics helped streamline the development process.

To prioritize tasks within each epic, I employed the MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't) for the issues.

On the Kanban board, I maintained three pivotal columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This setup proved invaluable, providing a clear overview of pending tasks and facilitating effective progress tracking.

Throughout the website development phase, I implemented two new columns within the Kanban board: "Epics" and "Future." The "Epics" column was designated for overarching stories, while the "Future" column contained user stories slated for integration after the project deadline. These additions provided significant insights for future reference and were documented in the readme for comprehensive understanding.

## Sprint Notes

Below is a summary of learnings from each iteration.

### Sprint 1 notes:

In the first sprint, my primary objective was to kickstart the project by addressing the user story focused on installing Django and the crucial supporting libraries. This initial step laid the essential foundation for the project, paving the way for subsequent stages of development. The successful completion of this user story marked a crucial milestone in establishing the development environment and setting the project in motion.

* User Story: Installing Django and Supporting Libraries

### Sprint 2 notes:

In the second sprint, I tackled several key user stories. First, I implemented Allauth to enhance authentication functionalities, ensuring a secure and user-friendly experience. Simultaneously, I crafted the foundational template for the website, providing a visual structure for further development.

The sprint also involved addressing the user story related to deploying the project on Heroku. I created the Heroku app and seamlessly connected it to the database, establishing a robust and scalable environment for the application. Additionally, I successfully completed the user story for the project's first deployment, marking a significant milestone in the development process.

Here's a breakdown of the key user stories and tasks accomplished during this sprint:
