## Overview

This was my second project and second time I used the agile methodologies. The GitHub project board served as my primary tool for organizing user stories. Opting for the GitHub board was a deliberate choice due to its simplicity and alignment with my learning path from the LMS course.

Initially, grappling with user stories posed a challenge, but after a day's immersion, I found myself growing more adept at handling them. I began by crafting detailed features for each task and those indispensable for the overall project. Categorizing issues into relevant groups and subsequently into their respective epics helped streamline the development process.

Given the ample time available for this project, I consolidated all tasks under a single milestone, setting the project deadline for 2024-03-31.

To prioritize tasks within each epic, I employed the MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't) for the issues.

On the Kanban board, I maintained three pivotal columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This setup proved invaluable, providing a clear overview of pending tasks and facilitating effective progress tracking.

During the website development phase, I introduced three additional columns to the Kanban board: "Epics," "Future," and "Known Bugs and Fixed Bugs." The "Epics" column housed overarching stories, while "Future" encompassed user stories yet to be incorporated before the deadline. The "Known Bugs and Fixed Bugs" column served as a repository for documenting bugs and known issues, offering valuable insights for future reference in the readme.
